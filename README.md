# NIST DDoS Incident Response Lab

## 📘 Overview
In this project, I analyzed a simulated DDoS incident involving an ICMP flood attack against a multimedia company. I applied the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** to manage and mitigate the attack across its five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**.

---

## 🧩 Incident Summary
- A **DDoS attack using ICMP packets** brought down the internal network for 2 hours.
- ICMP flood caused non-critical network services to stop.
- The team responded by isolating services and implementing firewall rules.

## 🔐 NIST Framework Implementation

**Identify:**  
Detected malicious ICMP traffic affecting the internal network.

**Protect:**  
Added a firewall rule to limit ICMP packet rates and used IDS/IPS systems to filter threats.

**Detect:**  
Deployed network monitoring tools to track abnormal traffic and user behavior.

**Respond:**  
Isolated non-critical services to reduce network load and stop the attack.

**Recover:**  
Restored critical systems first, then gradually brought other services back online.
